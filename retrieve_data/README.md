# Instructions

## State report
Let's create a report that shows which members of each team in the state of Colorado (CO) want a shirt or a hat for participating in our quiz. We'll sort the results in a way that keeps the data organized: first, we'll sort the participants by team, in alphabetical order, and then we'll sort by whether they want a shirt or hat. This also will be an alphabetical sort. Within each of these team-apparel combinations, we'll sort the participants by their last name, in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).

**Your task**: Create a list of participants in Colorado (state code CO) with the columns `TEAM`, `SHIRT_OR_HAT`, `FIRST_NAME`, and `LAST_NAME`. Organize the list so that the participants are sorted by their team name, then by whether they want a shirt or hat, and finally by their last name. Use descending order for the last names and ascending order for the other sorting fields.

## Result
Your result should have four columns:
- `TEAM`
- `SHIRT_OR_HAT`
- `FIRST_NAME`
- `LAST_NAME`

Your result should be sorted by:
- `TEAM` in ascending order
- `SHIRT_OR_HAT` in ascending order
- `LAST_NAME` in descending order
